Welcome JOrgan-Source,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project.

##UX

This website designed for a fictional digital design school called EduTech. The developer made use of a variety of infulences in the design
of this website Code Institute, Dublin Business School and Waterford College of Further Educatioon.
This website i targeted a people intrested in study digital media design and development. The fictional client need a website that was colourful and matched the kinds of courses on offer at EduTech.

The wireframes used are located in the wireframes folder of this project. The developer went through an iterative design process designing a number of hand drawn wireframes and used those as the basis for digital wireframes and than adapted the wireframes as the deveopment process proceeded.
To identify components parts of the website a crude initial colour scheme was adopted to help track those parts throughout the development of EduTech website an example screenshot of this can be seen in wireframe folder.

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here are the updates since the original video was made:

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
