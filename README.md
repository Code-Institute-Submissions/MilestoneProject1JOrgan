# Milestone Project 1 - EduTech - Ireland's Premier Digital Design School

### Dr.John Organ PhD

# UX

This website is designed for a fictional digital design school called EduTech. The developer made use of a variety of infulences in the design
of this website Code Institute, Dublin Business School and Waterford College of Further Education as well as N26. The website is targeted at potential students of EduTech and those with an interest in digitial design and media. In keeping with this target audience the website needed to be colourful and match the kinds of courses on offer at EduTech.

# Wireframes
The wireframes used are located in the wireframes folder of this project. The developer went through an iterative design process designing hand drawn wireframes and used those as the basis for digital wireframes and than adapted the wireframes as the development process proceeded.
To identify components parts of the website a crude initial colour scheme was adopted to help track the different of parts and changes to the the website throughout the development an example screenshot of this can be seen in wireframes folder. This allowed the developer to progressively enhance the website throughout the development of EduTech
